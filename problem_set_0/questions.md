â€¢	What is a Markdown file? 

A markdown file is a text file created using one of several possible dialects of the Markdown language. It uses plain text formatting but contains inline text symbols that specify how to format the text. Markdown files are designed for writing documentation in plain text that can be easily converted to HTML.
